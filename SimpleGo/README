This is UCT based Monte Carlo program coded partially in C and 
uses GNU Go libboard.
http://londerings.novalis.org/wlog/index.php?title=SimpleGo_v0.4.0

If it fails to load c_board module, it will revert to python code.
Basically v0.3.7+some changes.

Compilation:
Copy or symlink GNU Go sources to gnugo directory.
Then compile it using make.

Example:
ln -s /usr/local/src/gnugo-3.7.10 gnugo
make


Usage:
Play game against itself (warns if fails to load c_board module):
python simple_go.py


Play game using GTP (silently reverts to Python code if fails to 
load c_board module):
python play_gtp.py
